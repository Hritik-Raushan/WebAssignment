       <p> Hello, I am Hritik Raushan. I am from Bihar and currently lives in Chandigarh. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from Chandigarh University. I have maintained consistency in academics since schooling and I used to be in the top 5 of the class. I have also an interest in social reading apart from our regular course content. In fact, I want to go for the civil services preparation but the inconsistency in vacancies drive me into this technical field. Talking about my technical skills I have strong control over the C++ language. I also studied Web Development and Computer Programming. I am currently working on the covid-19 info website.</p>
